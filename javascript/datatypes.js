// datatypes 2 types - primitive and non primitive (classes n objects)
// strings can have double quotes, single quotes and even back ticks `

const name = 'soham'
const college = 'iiit'
const stream = 'ece'

 // 3 datatypes are - strings shown above, numbers that represent integers and floating point numbers and booleans which are only either of true or false

 //numbers
 const total=0
 const PI = 3.14

 //booleans
 const isPrim = true


 // undefined where value is not assigned at declaration

 let vari
 //undefined
 console.log(vari)

 const a = undefined

 // null datatype  to assign a value not known, so a better option to prev code in line 24 is

 const b = null

 // other primitive types are BigInt and Symbol datatypes
